# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

`yg` is a YAML template generator written in Go. This is an early-stage project currently containing only basic project structure.

## Development Setup

This project uses Go. Standard Go development commands will apply once the codebase is established:

- `go mod init` - Initialize Go module (when first setting up)
- `go build` - Build the project
- `go test ./...` - Run all tests
- `go run .` - Run the main application

## Architecture

The project structure will follow standard Go conventions with the main package in the root directory.
